## Performance Benchmarks

| Test Case                   | Expected Response Time | Notes                       |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| No filters                  | < 200ms                | Baseline query              |
| Price filter                | < 150ms                | Using IX_rooms_price        |
| Status filter               | < 100ms                | Using IX_rooms_status       |
| Status + Price              | < 100ms                | Using IX_rooms_status_price |
| With pagination             | < 150ms                | Efficient with indexes      |
| Complex query (all filters) | < 300ms                | Multiple index usage        |

## SQL Query Examples

### Query Generated (No Filters)

```sql
SELECT r FROM RoomEntity r
LEFT JOIN FETCH r.bedLayout bl
WHERE r.status IN ('available')
ORDER BY r.pricePerNight ASC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

### Query Generated (With Filters)

```sql
SELECT r FROM RoomEntity r
LEFT JOIN FETCH r.bedLayout bl
WHERE r.status IN ('available', 'occupied')
  AND r.pricePerNight >= 1000000
  AND r.pricePerNight <= 5000000
  AND bl.layoutName IN ('1 giường đôi')
ORDER BY r.pricePerNight ASC
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY;
```

## Tips for Testing

1. **Use Postman Collection**: Import as collection for easier testing
2. **Check Response Headers**: Verify `Content-Type: application/json`
3. **Validate Pagination**: total / size = expected pages
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty results, invalid params, large page numbers
5. **Performance**: Monitor response times with `time curl ...`
6. **Database State**: Ensure test data exists in `rooms` table

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Empty Results

- Check if rooms exist in database
- Verify filters are not too restrictive
- Check room status (default only shows 'available')

### Issue: Slow Response

- Run `UPDATE STATISTICS rooms;`
- Check if indexes are created (see migration README)
- Monitor with SQL Profiler

### Issue: 500 Error

- Check application logs
- Verify database connection
- Check for SQL syntax errors in repository query
